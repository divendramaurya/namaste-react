cdn:::
cdn => content delivery networks is place, where react library has been hosted. we can pull react from there into our project.
A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
The popularity of CDN services continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.


crossorigin:::
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain
crossorigin :  The crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute.
cors , mai same same origin policy by default... so can request data only from own url/domain   foo.com => foo.com
--When a browser makes a request it adds  a origin header to the request,If the request goes to the server on the same origin then the request is allowed.
--If the request goes to the different URL then It is called as cross origin request. While sending the response the server will add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header    foo.com => bar.com
--CORS is a relaxation of the same-origin policy implemented in modern browsers. Without features like CORS, websites are restricted to accessing resources from the same origin through what is known as same-origin policy.


Should I put JavaScript in head or body?:::
For scripts that are critical to the page contents and should be loaded first such as analytics, API, or authentication-type of scripts, it is recommended to place them in the head section of the HTML page. And other script tags should be placed at the bottom of the page before the closing </body> tag.
Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

Difference between react.development.js and react.production.min.js?
--In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.
--The production link is meant for deploying your application in a production environment. It excludes development-specific tools, warnings, and error messages. It is smaller in file size, which improves the performance of your application. It is optimized for production.

-- React is a library, it can also be applied even to a small portion of the page. React only works in the page whatever you make the root as, keeping other html things remains unchanged.
-- React can work independently in a small portion of application. Its a library and not a framework.
-- React is a bare bone minimal js library.
-- React just gives us some helper methods to develop application faster.

--Git
To make a particular repo as git respository hit => git init
To create a main as a main branch                => git branch -M main

--README.md is a markup file.
